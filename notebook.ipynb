Colour and Color. Words like these have been the cause of many heated arguments between Brits and Americans. Accents (and jokes) aside, there are many words that are pronounced the same way but have different spellings. While it is easy for us to realize their equivalence, basic programming commands will fail to equate such two strings. </p>\n<p>More extreme than word spellings are names because people have more flexibility in choosing to spell a name in a certain way. To some extent, tradition sometimes governs the way a name is spelled, which limits the number of variations of any given English name. But if we consider global names and their associated English spellings, you can only imagine how many ways they can be spelled out. </p>\n<p>One way to tackle this challenge is to write a program that checks if two strings sound the same, instead of checking for equivalence in spellings. We'll do that here using fuzzy name matching.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the fuzzy package\n# ...

The inbetweeners\n<p>We'll use <code>babynames_nysiis.csv</code>, a dataset that is derived from <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html\">the Social Security Administration’s baby name data</a>, to identify author genders. The dataset contains unique NYSIIS versions of baby names, and also includes the percentage of times the name appeared as a female name (<code>perc_female</code>) and the percentage of times it appeared as a male name (<code>perc_male</code>). </p>\n<p>We'll use this data to create a list of <code>gender</code>. Let's make the following simplifying assumption: For each name, if <code>perc_female</code> is greater than <code>perc_male</code> then assume the name is female, if <code>perc_female</code> is less than <code>perc_male</code> then assume it is a male name, and if the percentages are equal then it's a \"neutral\" name.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"24"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading in datasets/babynames_nysiis.csv, which is semicolon delimited.\nbabies_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/babynames_nysiis.csv', delimiter=';')\n\n# Looping through the rows of babies_df to and filling up gender\ngender = []\nfor idx in range(len(babies_df['babynysiis'])):\n    if babies_df.perc_female[idx] > babies_df.perc_male[idx]:\n        gender.append('F')\n    elif babies_df.perc_female[idx] < babies_df.perc_male[idx]:\n        gender.append('M')\n    else:\n        gender.append('N')\n\n# Adding a gender column to babies_df\nbabies_df['gender'] = gender\n\n# Printing out the first few rows of babies_df\nbabies_df.head()","execution_count":179,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":179,"data":{"text/plain":"  babynysiis  perc_female  perc_male gender\n0        NaN        62.50      37.50      F\n1        RAX        63.64      36.36      F\n2       ESAR        44.44      55.56      M\n3      DJANG         0.00     100.00      M\n4     PARCAL        25.00      75.00      M","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>babynysiis</th>\n      <th>perc_female</th>\n      <th>perc_male</th>\n      <th>gender</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>62.50</td>\n      <td>37.50</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>RAX</td>\n      <td>63.64</td>\n      <td>36.36</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>ESAR</td>\n      <td>44.44</td>\n      <td>55.56</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>DJANG</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>100.00</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>PARCAL</td>\n      <td>25.00</td>\n      <td>75.00</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"31"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.
